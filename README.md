# illustrator_panel_tools
This repository includes two scripts validated for Adobe Illustrator 2025 to automatically resize square images to the same dimensions (same_size.jsx) and subsequintly create a perfect grid of images given a number of columns and provided spacing (autogrid.jsx). This was specifically made to help quickly create perfeectly sized and spaced multi-image microscopy panels which can't be natively performed in Illustrator in a single-click.

### Installation and Running the Scripts 

**Option 1:** Copy the scripts to the Scripts/ folder in Adobe Illustrator 2025 and restart. You will likely require elevated user permission to do this.
The path may look something like this:
* C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 2025\Presets\en_US\Scripts

**Option 2:** Run the scripts from wherever they are located on your system with
* **File** --> **Scripts** --> **Other Scripts..** --> run the desired .jsx files
* Or better yet, press Ctrl+F12 while in illustrator to open the scripts locator.
